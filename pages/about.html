                Welcome to my corner of the web! My name is Dylan Longwith, a passionate person of many hobbies based in Tennessee. With years of experience in Video Editing, web development, and computer hardware, I've immersed myself in Video Editing, finding boundless joy in creating gaming montages. My journey in Video Editing began when I was in middle school and couldn't find anyone to edit my montages for free, and it's been a fulfilling path ever since.
